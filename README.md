# Word Mapper

A dynamic, interactive visualization tool that creates floating bubbles from text input, where each bubble represents a word and its size corresponds to its frequency.

  - Hide common words (articles, prepositions, etc.)
  - Control bubble movement speed
  - Set minimum word frequency threshold
- **Physics Simulation**: Bubbles collide and bounce realistically
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size

## How to Use

1. Type or paste text into the input box at the bottom of the screen
2. Press Enter to create bubbles (Shift+Enter for new line)
